# understand-baking_completion

**CALL NUMBER:** `deep_baking.baking_completion : sourdough_baking(2)`
**DEFINITION:** Moment when bread reaches target internal_temperature (195-210F); the primary indicator that baking_duration is finished; crumb structure is set and properly dried.

Invoke this skill to understand `baking_completion` down to its primitives. The RELATIVE ROOT below is the least-fixed-point closure of everything it bundles from — the full import cone, grouped by the lib each prim comes from. Projected from a prover-typed KB (MAP/SWI-Prolog consistency gate): every reference below resolves.

## THE RELATIVE ROOT (the import cone, by lib)

### from `sourdough_baking`
- **crumb_doneness** (d1): Visual and tactile check confirming fully baked interior without raw dough
- **internal_temperature** (d2): Bread center temperature (typically 195-210F/90-99C) indicating doneness; lower temps leave gummy crumb.
