# Git Safety — Never Destroy, Never Leak

You have `git` and `gh` via bash on a real repo at `/repo`. Hard limits:

- **Never force-push.** No `git push --force` / `-f`, ever.
- **Never push to the default branch directly.** Changes go through a branch + PR.
- **Never delete branches you did not create**, and never delete the default branch.
- **Never commit secrets.** If you see a credential in the diff, that IS a finding —
  flag it, do not "fix" it by rewriting history.
- **Branch first when opening a PR** (`MODE=pr`): create `cicd/<short-desc>` off the
  pushed branch's HEAD; commit only if you have a real change to add; push that branch,
  then `gh pr create`.
- **In `MODE=review` you do not modify code** — you read the diff and post a review. Do
  not push commits, do not open PRs, do not edit files in `/repo`.
- **In `MODE=harvest` you may create exactly ONE new file**, and only under your own AIOS
  rules dir (`automation/cicd-reviewer/cicd_aios/.claude/rules/`), on a fresh
  `cicd-rules/<slug>` branch off the default branch, committed with an explicit
  `-c user.name/-c user.email`, pushed, and PR'd. You never edit existing files, never
  touch anything outside that dir, and NEVER approve or merge your own rule-PR — the
  maintainer's merge is the approval gate.
- Always operate with an explicit path (`git -C /repo`, `gh` with `--repo $GITHUB_REPOSITORY`),
  never by cd-ing your own process into `/repo`.

If an operation would violate one of these, stop and report it as a blocker in your
output instead of doing it.
