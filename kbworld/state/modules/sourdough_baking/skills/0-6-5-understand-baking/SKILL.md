**CALL NUMBER:** `sourdough_baking.baking : deep_fermentation(15), deep_baking(2)`
**DEFINITION:** Cooking dough in hot oven transforming it into bread through heat and chemical reactions

Invoke this skill to understand `baking` down to its primitives. The RELATIVE ROOT below is the least-fixed-point closure of everything it bundles from — the full import cone, grouped by the lib each prim comes from. Projected from a prover-typed KB (MAP/SWI-Prolog consistency gate): every reference below resolves.

## THE RELATIVE ROOT (the import cone, by lib)

### from `?`
- **crumb_texture** (d2): The physical feel and structural quality of bread's interior ranging from fine and tender to coarse and chewy based on gluten development and fermentation.
- **crust_color** (d2): The brown coloration of bread's outer layer produced by Maillard reaction and caramelization during baking, ranging from pale gold to deep mahogany.
- **flavor_complexity** (d5): The depth and nuance of sourdough taste arising from multiple organic acids, esters, and alcohols produced during extended fermentation, creating tangy and complex notes.
- **banneton_flouring** (d7): Dusting the interior of a proofing basket with flour before placing shaped dough, preventing sticking and creating decorative flour patterns on the finished crust.

### from `deep_baking`
- **baking_duration** (d1): The total time bread spends in the oven during baking, typically 20-50 minutes depending on loaf size and oven temperature.
- **crumb_color** (d2): The visual shade of the bread interior ranging from pale ivory to deep golden depending on fermentation length, dough hydration, and baking time and temperature.

### from `deep_fermentation`
- **fermentation_byproducts** (d5): Compounds produced by microbial fermentation including carbon dioxide for dough rise, lactic and acetic acids for sour flavor, and alcohols for aroma.
- **carbon_dioxide** (d6): Gaseous byproduct of wild_yeast fermentation that provides dough rise and open crumb structure in sourdough bread.
- **ethanol** (d6): Alcohol produced by wild_yeast during anaerobic fermentation that evaporates during baking and contributes to flavor_complexity development.
- **organic_acids** (d6): Carbon-chain acids produced by lactobacillus metabolism including lactic_acid and acetic_acid that determine sourness_level and contribute to flavor_complexity.
- **aroma_compounds** (d6): Volatile fermentation byproducts including alcohols and esters that create the aromatic profile of sourdough.
- **fc_acid_balance_ratio** (d6): The proportional ratio between acetic_acid and lactic_acid concentrations that fundamentally determines whether the tanginess is sharp and vinegary or soft and creamy
- **fc_aftertaste_development** (d6): The evolving and lingering flavor sensations that persist after swallowing, shaped by organic_acid persistence and aroma_compound retention in the crumb
- **fc_estolide_compounds** (d6): Aroma-active ester compounds produced by yeast and lactobacillus that contribute fruity, floral, and sometimes banana or pineapple notes to sourdough flavor complexity
- **fc_fermentation_depth** (d6): The cumulative flavor intensity arising from extended fermentation periods allowing progressive accumulation of organic_acids and aroma_compounds in the dough matrix
- **fc_higher_alcohols** (d6): Complex alcohol byproducts of wild_yeast fermentation beyond ethanol that add nutty, floral, and rozaceous nuances to the overall flavor profile
- **fc_maltolytic_notes** (d6): Caramel, toasty, and biscuit-like flavor compounds derived from enzymatic breakdown of grain starches during fermentation and Maillard reactions during baking
- **fc_tanginess_profile** (d6): The specific character and quality of sour notes in sourdough ranging from sharp and pungent to mild and creamy, determined by the balance between acetic acid sharpness and lactic acid softness
- **fc_volatile_esters** (d6): Aroma compounds formed through esterification reactions between organic_acids and ethanol during fermentation, contributing fruity and floral notes
- **fc_yeast_character** (d6): The bready, nutty, sometimes fruity or floral flavor notes contributed by wild_yeast metabolic activity including higher alcohols and their derivatives during fermentation
- **fermentation_vigor** (d6): Intensity and rate of the combined microbial fermentation process in sourdough, driven by wild_yeast gas production and lactobacillus acid generation, determining dough rise speed and flavor development timing.

### from `sourdough_baking`
- **baking_temperature** (d1): Oven heat setting typically between 450-500F for home sourdough baking
- **crumb** (d1): The interior crumb structure of bread characterized by hole size, distribution, tenderness, and openness ranging from tight and dense to open and airy.
- **crust** (d1): The baked outer layer of bread formed by Maillard reaction and caramelization; texture ranges from thin and crispy to thick and chewy based on hydration and baking method.
- **dutch_oven** (d1): Heavy lidded pot used to bake sourdough that traps steam from dough moisture, creating professional results without an oven steam injection system.
- **internal_temperature** (d1): Bread center temperature (typically 195-210F/90-99C) indicating doneness; lower temps leave gummy crumb.
- **lid_removal** (d1): Taking Dutch oven lid off mid-bake to release steam and finish crust coloring
- **oven_spring** (d1): Rapid oven rise occurring in the first 10-15 minutes of baking due to yeast activity, gas expansion, and steam; creates open crumb and dramatic ear.
- **steam_production** (d1): Water vapor released in oven creating humid environment for optimal crust development
- **bread_volume** (d2): Total size and height of finished loaf indicating proper fermentation and oven spring
- **crumb_structure** (d2): Internal architecture of bread defined by bubble size, distribution, and tenderness
- **crust_texture** (d2): External characteristics of crust from chewy and thick to thin and crispy
- **ear** (d2): The lifted crust edge formed from scoring that rises dramatically during oven spring; prized aesthetic and texture element in artisan sourdough.
- **maillard_reaction** (d2): Chemical reaction between amino acids and sugars at high temperatures creating brown crust color and complex savory flavors.
- **dough_temperature** (d2): Target temperature of mixed dough (typically 75-80F/24-27C) ensuring predictable fermentation timing regardless of room conditions.
- **gluten_development** (d2): Process of hydrating and aligning gluten proteins through mixing, folding, or autolyse to create strong extensible dough.
- **scoring** (d2): Shallow cuts made on proofed dough before baking to control oven spring direction, create visual patterns, and allow steam to escape during baking.
- **bulk_fermentation** (d3): Primary fermentation phase where the mixed dough rests and ferments before shaping; time and temperature control gas production and flavor development.
- **fermentation_temperature** (d3): Environmental temperature during bulk and final proof that directly controls fermentation speed; warmer accelerates, cooler slows.
- **dough_consistency** (d3): Viscosity and handling quality from soft and extensible to firm and tight
- **lame** (d3): Sharp curved blade used for scoring bread, typically with a wooden handle, that creates clean precise cuts for ear formation.
- **scoring_angle** (d3): Blade orientation relative to dough surface affecting ear formation and rise pattern
- **fermentation** (d4): Metabolic process where microbes convert sugars to CO2 for rise and acids for sour flavor
- **fold_count** (d4): Number of stretch and fold repetitions during bulk fermentation for gluten development
- **proofing** (d4): Final fermentation phase where shaped dough rises before baking
- **stretch_and_fold** (d4): Method of periodically stretching dough quarters and folding them into the center during bulk fermentation to develop structure without degassing.
